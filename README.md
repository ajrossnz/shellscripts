# shellscripts
various shell scripts I made for public consumption that may prove useful to someone out there

### mailsync-run.sh 
a script I bodged to send me an X11 notification if there is new mail
basically a biff for X11 using notify-send, but runs mailsync to fetch the
mail too

### transcode_for_davinci.sh
In Davinci Resolve, for some reason the Linux version doesn't seem to like normal MP4 files that my Sony camera takes, so I wrote an ffmpeg conversion util that transcodes them into a MOV file that Davinci likes.
